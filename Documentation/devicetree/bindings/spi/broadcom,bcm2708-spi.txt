* Broadcom BCM2708 SPI driver

This is used on the Raspberry Pi with the Broadcom BCM2835 SoC.

Required properties:
- compatible : Should be "broadcom,bcm2708-spi"
- reg : Should contain SPI register base and length
- interrupt-parent : Should point to an interrupt controller
- interrupts : Should contain the BSC interrupt number
- #address-cells : Must be 1
- #size-cells : Must be 0

Optional properties:
- linux,realtime : Boolean property that makes the SPI message pump run with
  realtime priority
- Child nodes conforming to spi bus binding

Examples:

spi {
	#address-cells = <1>;
	#size-cells = <0>;
	compatible = "broadcom,bcm2708-spi";
	reg = <0x20204000 0x18>;
	interrupt-parent = <&vic2>;
	interrupts = <22>;
};
