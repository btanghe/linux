* Broadcom BCM2708 BSC driver

This is used on the Raspberry Pi with the Broadcom BCM2835 SoC. Broadcom Serial
Controller is a Broadcom proprietary bus compatible with I2C.

Required properties:
- compatible : Should be "broadcom,bcm2708-i2c"
- reg : Should contain BSC register base and length
- interrupt-parent : Should point to an interrupt controller
- interrupts : Should contain the BSC interrupt number
- #address-cells : Must be 1
- #size-cells : Must be 0

Optional properties:
- clock-frequency : Constains desired I2C/BSC bus clock frequency in Hz.
  The absence of the propoerty indicates the default frequency 100 kHz.
- Child nodes conforming to i2c bus binding

Examples:

bsc0 {
	#address-cells = <1>;
	#size-cells = <0>;
	compatible = "broadcom,bcm2708-i2c";
	reg = <0x20205000 0x18>;
	interrupt-parent = <&vic2>;
	interrupts = <21>;
};
